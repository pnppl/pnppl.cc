# This is a heading

This is a [paragraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragraph) with [some
links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink) in it.

Next we'll have a list of some musicians I like, but as an individual list of
links. One of the neat features of goldmark-gemtext is that it recognizes when
a "paragraph" is really just a list of links and handles it as if it's a list
of links by simply converting them to the gemtext format. I wasn't able to find
any other markdown to gemtext tools that could do this so it was the
inspiration for writing this in the first place.
